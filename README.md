# Conway's Game of Life
An Android implementation of John Conway's 1970 cellular automaton. Part of <a href="https://seal.ece.ucsb.edu/">UCSB SEAL</a>'s high school outreach program.

# Rules
In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>, every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, or generation, the following transitions occur.
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
